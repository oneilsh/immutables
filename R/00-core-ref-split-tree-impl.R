# core split implementation following Hinze/Paterson 4.4

# split_tree_impl returns a distinguished element with left/right context:
#   list(left = FingerTree, elem = element, right = FingerTree)
# It assumes:
# - t is non-empty
# - p(i) is FALSE and p(i <> measure(t)) is TRUE for strict split semantics
# The public wrappers relax these preconditions (matching the paper's split).
# Runtime: O(log n) near split point depth.
