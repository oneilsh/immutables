# Monoid-annotated 2-3 Finger Trees in R

Alpha tests on monoid-annotated fingertrees in R. Please note that this repository is very much an alpha work-in-progress; code is 
inefficient, functionality is missing. 

`R/` - implementation files for the 2-3 finger tree and reducers.

`scripts/monoids_demo.R` - demo/exploration of monoid-annotated binary trees (not 2-3 finger trees).

`R/monoids_typed.R` - typed monoid/tree implementation using `lambda.r`.

`scripts/` - demo/experiment scripts for finger trees and plotting.
