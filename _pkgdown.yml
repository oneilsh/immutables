  - title: "Flexible Sequence (flexseq)"
    desc: |
      General-purpose persistent sequence with O(1) amortized push/pop at
      both ends, O(log n) indexing and replacement, and efficient split/concat.
    contents:
      - flexseq
      - as_flexseq
      - push_front
      - push_back
      - pop_front
      - pop_back
      - peek_front
      - peek_back
      - split_at
      - "c.flexseq"
      - "[.flexseq"
      - "print.flexseq"
      - "length.flexseq"
      - "as.list.flexseq"
      - "fapply.flexseq"
      - "plot.flexseq"

  - title: "Priority Queue"
    desc: |
      Persistent priority queue with O(log n) insert and min/max peek/pop.
      Name-based read indexing only; cast with `as_flexseq()` for full
      sequence operations.
    contents:
      - priority_queue
      - as_priority_queue
      - insert.priority_queue
      - peek_min
      - peek_max
      - pop_min
      - pop_max
      - "[.priority_queue"
      - "[[.priority_queue"
      - "print.priority_queue"
      - "length.priority_queue"
      - "fapply.priority_queue"
      - "plot.priority_queue"

  - title: "Ordered Sequence"
    desc: |
      Persistent key-ordered sequence with O(log n) insert, key lookup,
      and range queries. Read indexing preserves key order; replacement
      indexing is not supported.
    contents:
      - ordered_sequence
      - as_ordered_sequence
      - insert.ordered_sequence
      - peek_key
      - pop_key
      - lower_bound
      - upper_bound
      - elements_between
      - count_key
      - count_between
      - "[.ordered_sequence"
      - "print.ordered_sequence"
      - "length.ordered_sequence"
      - "as.list.ordered_sequence"
      - "fapply.ordered_sequence"
      - "plot.ordered_sequence"

  - title: "Developer Tools"
    desc: "Lower-level primitives for custom monoids, predicate queries, and validation."
    contents:
      - insert
      - fapply
      - add_monoids
      - locate_by_predicate
      - split_around_by_predicate
      - split_by_predicate
      - measure_monoid
      - predicate
      - validate_tree
      - validate_name_state
