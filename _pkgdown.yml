  - title: "flexseq"
    desc: |
      Persistent sequences with fast push/pop/peek operations for 
      double-ended queue behavior. Quick and memory-efficient
      concatenation and splitting by name or index. Other structures
      below (e.g. priority queues) 
    contents:
      - flexseq
      - as_flexseq
      - push_front
      - push_back
      - pop_front
      - pop_back
      - peek_front
      - peek_back
      - split_at
      - "c.flexseq"
      - "print.flexseq"
      - "length.flexseq"
      - "as.list.flexseq"
      - "lapply.flexseq"
      - "plot.flexseq"
  
  - title: flexseq indexing
    desc: |
      Indexing functions for list-like behavior. Note that these 
      operations are generally $O(k\log(n))$ where $k$ is the
      size of the index vector and $n$ the size of the sequence.
    contents:
      - "[.flexseq"
      - "[[.flexseq"
      - "[<-.flexseq"
      - "[[<-.flexseq"
      - "$.flexseq"
      - "$<-.flexseq"


  - title: "priority_queue"
    desc: |
      Persistent priority queues associate priority values with 
      items and provide $O(\log(n))$ insertion and min/max operations.
      Priority queues intentionally expose queue-oriented APIs only;
      sequence-style edits/traversal should cast first with
      `as_flexseq()`.

    contents:
      - priority_queue
      - as_priority_queue
      - insert
      - peek_min
      - peek_max
      - pop_min
      - pop_max
      - "length.priority_queue"
      - "lapply.priority_queue"
      - "print.priority_queue"

  - title: "ordered_sequence"
    desc: |
      Persistent key-ordered sequences.
    contents:
      - ordered_sequence
      - as_ordered_sequence
      - insert
      - peek_key
      - pop_key
      - lower_bound
      - upper_bound
      - elements_between
      - count_key
      - count_between
      - "print.ordered_sequence"

      - locate_by_predicate
      - split_around_by_predicate
      - split_by_predicate
      - measure_monoid
