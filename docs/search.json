Risk: callers relying previous argument names/error behavior need updates. eb493fd: removed delete_one/delete_all; peek_key() pop_key() now support = \"first\"|\"\" \"\" operates full duplicate-key runs returns ordered slice. Risk: code using deleted functions assuming pop_key() always pops one element must migrate. eb493fd: pop_front()/pop_back() now return element (value) plus rest; tests/docs/vignette updated. Risk: callers using $value must switch $element. eb493fd: removed ordered_multiset API/tests dropped package-level set-op generics (union/intersect/setdiff) tied surface. Risk: code importing package methods must migrate explicit sequence operations. eb493fd: hardened C++ monoid/measures field access GC pressure src/ft_cpp.cpp (name lookup fallback monoid subfields; recursive fallback .size/.named_count reads measure names missing). Risk: GC torture remains expensive; pop_key(='') excluded GC-stress assertions keep suite deterministic. eb493fd: ensure_size_monoids() now canonicalizes every monoid spec named list(f, , measure) validates f/measure functions use. Impact: C++ positional fallback remains safe even monoid list names absent; risk: malformed custom MeasureMonoid objects now fail earlier clearer errors. eb493fd: benchmark harness longer references removed ordered_multiset/set-op scenarios; quick/full profiles now target live APIs . Risk: historical OMS benchmark comparisons longer directly reproducible default profiles. eb493fd: quick/full benchmark profiles now include ordered_sequence_insert keep ordered-keyed workload coverage OMS removal; pq_insert_pop remains available custom-scenario. Risk: historical quick/full trend lines one scenario changed. eb493fd: full-profile benchmark sizes reduced high-cost R-backend scenarios (flexseq_tree_from*, split variants, index reads, as_flexseq_only) keep single-scenario runs within ~30s capped. Risk: full-profile values less stress-heavy earlier settings. eb493fd: fixed insert.ordered_sequence() R fallback boundary case (use_cpp=FALSE) avoiding public push_back() guard appending split-left fragments; ordered_sequence_insert benchmarks now execute R backend. Risk: internal append helper path continue preserve ordered wrapping invariants (covered ordered-sequence tests). eb493fd: benchmark coverage now includes additional non-flexseq structure scenarios (ordered_sequence_bounds, pq_insert_pop) quick/full profiles R-safe parameter sizes. Risk: scenario names/default params changed; compare historical runs scenario+params, just run label. eb493fd: added deeper ordered-sequence priority-queue benchmark scenarios (ordered_sequence_range_queries, ordered_sequence_pop_cycle, pq_peek_min_max, pq_pop_min_drain, pq_mixed_ops) improve optimization signal across lookup vs mutation-heavy paths. Risk: broader quick/full profiles increase total run time; use run_scenarios() focused profiling. f300088: interval_index query surface now uses peek_point/peek_overlaps/peek_containing/peek_within plus pop_point/relation pop_*; removed find_* interval query helpers exports/docs/tests. Risk: callers using removed find_* APIs must migrate peek_*/pop_*. f300088: ordered-subclass blocker errors now report concrete subclass names inherited mutation endpoints (c, push_front, push_back, insert_at, [<-, [[<-, $<-) rather hardcoded ordered_sequence. Risk: callers/tests matching exact prior error strings may need updates. 53437c6+local: removed legacy internal ordered merge path (.ft_cpp_oms_set_merge) R wrapper, C registration, C++ implementation, parity/GC test references “ordered merge” remains true across layers. Risk: developer-code invoking removed internal symbol now errors must wait planned clean reimplementation. 53437c6+local: tightened test signal quality (validate_* now asserts invisible TRUE, redundant test-seq-apply monoid case folded one stronger persistence assertion, element tests now assert value-level identity list/data.frame payloads). Risk: stricter tests may fail immediately semantics intentionally change require explicit test updates. Root cause: bare SEXP variables holding newly-allocated R objects (R function calls make_* helpers) invisible R’s GC, scan C++ stack. subsequent R allocation (including Rcpp Function::operator() building call via Rf_lang3) can trigger GC collect temporaries. Pattern 1 — unprotected R function results used args another R function call: e.g. SEXP m = measure(ch); f(acc.get(), m). f() call allocates build LANGSXP executing, collecting m. Fix: Shield<SEXP> m(measure(ch)); f(acc.get(), (SEXP)m). Affected: measures_from_children, measure_sequence, locate_digit_impl_cpp, split_digit_cpp. Pattern 2 — multiple make_* results direct arguments make_deep: e.g. make_deep(make_digit(...), make_empty(...), make_digit(...), monoids). C++ argument eval order implementation-defined; make_* allocates heavily. Fix: Shield result passing. Affected: tree_from_sorted_list_cpp, digit_to_tree_cpp. Pattern 3 — unprotected make_* results List::push_back: push_back reallocates list, can collect unprotected temporary. Fix: Shield push_back. Affected: measured_nodes_cpp. Safe patterns (fix needed): d[\"prefix\"], sm[\"left\"], ms[monoid_name] etc. return pointers existing protected lists — elements kept alive parent objects attribute chain back .Call arguments.
