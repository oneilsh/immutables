\alias{as_flexseq}
\title{Coerce to a Persistent Flexible Sequence}
\usage{
as_flexseq(x, monoids = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input vector/list-like object.}

\item{monoids}{Optional named list of measure monoids.}
}
\value{
A `flexseq` object.
}
\description{
For `priority_queue` inputs, this explicitly drops queue behavior and returns
a plain `flexseq` so full sequence operations are available.
}
\examples{
x <- as_flexseq(1:5)
x

x2 <- as_flexseq(list(one = 1, two = 2, three = 3))
x2

q <- priority_queue("a", "b", priorities = c(2, 1))
as_flexseq(q)
}
