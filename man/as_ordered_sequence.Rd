\title{Build an Ordered Sequence from elements}
\usage{
as_ordered_sequence(x, keys)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Elements to add.}

\item{keys}{Scalar key values matching `x` length.

Ordered sequences are always key-sorted. Subsetting with `[` is intentionally
constrained to strictly increasing mapped positions (no duplicates or
reordering) so the result remains ordered.}
}
\value{
An `ordered_sequence`.
