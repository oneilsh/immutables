\description{
Sequence objects (`flexseq()`) supporting indexed and named access,
appending and prepending, concatenation, splitting, fast push
and pop from either end, item removal, and more.
}
\details{
Also implemented are priority queues (`priority_queue()`) 
focused on queue-oriented operations, including min and max
peeking and popping by priority value.

Backed by monoid-annotated 2-3 fingertrees, all structures are
persistent (operations return effective modified copies), and
most operations are constant time, amortized constant time, or
\eqn{O(\log n)} (indexing k elements is \eqn{O(k \log n)}). The
developer API supports the addition of custom structures 
via combinations of monoids and measures; see vignettes for
details.
