\title{Locate First Predicate Flip Without Reconstructing Context Trees}
\usage{
locate_by_predicate(
  t,
  predicate,
  monoid_name,
  accumulator = NULL,
  include_metadata = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A `flexseq`.}

\item{predicate}{Function on accumulated measure values.}

\item{monoid_name}{Name of monoid from `attr(t, "monoids")`.}

\item{accumulator}{Optional starting measure (defaults to monoid identity).}

\item{include_metadata}{Logical; include left/hit/right measures and index.}
}
\value{
If `include_metadata = FALSE`: `list(found, elem)`.
  If `TRUE`: `list(found, elem, metadata = list(left_measure, hit_measure,
  right_measure, index))`.
}
\description{
Read-only analogue of [split_around_by_predicate()]: finds the distinguished
element where the scan predicate flips, but does not rebuild left/right
trees.
}
\details{
For `priority_queue` objects, `metadata$index` (when requested) is the
internal structural position in the underlying sequence representation. It is
not related to priority rank and is not stable across queue updates, so it
should be treated as diagnostic metadata only.
