\title{Peek elements for one key}
\usage{
peek_key(x, key, which = c("first", "all"), if_missing = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An `ordered_sequence`.}

\item{key}{Query key.}

\item{which}{One of `"first"` or `"all"`.}

\item{if_missing}{Value returned when no matching key is present.}
}
\value{
For `which = "first"`, raw stored element or `if_missing` when not
  found. For `which = "all"`, an ordered sequence with matching elements
  (possibly empty).
}
\description{
For `which = "first"`, returns the first (leftmost) sequence element among
entries whose key equals `key`.
}
\details{
For `which = "all"`, returns an ordered sequence containing exactly the
entries whose key equals `key`.
}
