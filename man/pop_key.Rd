\title{Pop elements for one key}
\usage{
pop_key(x, key, which = c("first", "all"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An `ordered_sequence`.}

\item{key}{Query key.}

\item{which}{One of `"first"` or `"all"`.}
}
\value{
List with `element`, `key`, and updated `sequence`.
  When no match exists, returns `list(element = NULL, key = NULL, sequence = x)`
  for `which = "first"`, or
  `list(element = <empty ordered_sequence>, key = NULL, sequence = x)` for
  `which = "all"`.
}
\description{
For `which = "first"`, removes and returns the first (leftmost) sequence
element among entries whose key equals `key`.
}
\details{
For `which = "all"`, removes and returns all matching entries as an ordered
sequence.
}
