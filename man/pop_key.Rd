\title{Pop elements for one key}
\usage{
pop_key(x, key, which = c("first", "all"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An `ordered_sequence`.}

\item{key}{Query key.}

\item{which}{One of `"first"` or `"all"`.}
}
\value{
List with `element`, `key`, and updated `sequence`.
  For `which = "first"`:
  - On match: `element` is the first matching item; `key` is its key.
  - On miss: `element = NULL`, `key = NULL`, `sequence = x`.

  For `which = "all"`:
  - `element` is an `ordered_sequence` containing all matching items (in
  stable order). This may have size 0 (miss), 1 (single match), or >1
  (multiple matches).
  - `key` is the normalized key on match, otherwise `NULL`.
  - `sequence` is the original sequence with that entire key-run removed
  (or unchanged on miss).
}
\description{
For `which = "first"`, removes and returns the first (leftmost) sequence
element among entries whose key equals `key`.
}
\details{
For `which = "all"`, removes and returns all matching entries as an ordered
sequence.
}
