\title{Pop elements for one key}
\usage{
pop_key(x, key, which = c("first", "all"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An `ordered_sequence`.}

\item{key}{Query key.}

\item{which}{One of `"first"` or `"all"`.}
}
\value{
A named list with components \code{element}, \code{key}, and
  \code{remaining}.
  \itemize{
  \item For \code{which = "first"}:
  \itemize{
  \item On match: \code{element} is the first matching item and \code{key}
  is its key.
  \item On miss: \code{element = NULL}, \code{key = NULL},
  \code{remaining = x}.
  }
  \item For \code{which = "all"}:
  \itemize{
  \item \code{element} is an \code{ordered_sequence} of all matching items in
  stable order. It may have size 0 (miss), 1 (single match), or greater than
  1 (multiple matches).
  \item \code{key} is the normalized key on match, otherwise \code{NULL}.
  \item \code{remaining} is the original sequence with that full key-run
  removed (or unchanged on miss).
  }
  }
}
\description{
For `which = "first"`, removes and returns the first (leftmost) sequence
element among entries whose key equals `key`.
}
\details{
For `which = "all"`, removes and returns all matching entries as an ordered
sequence.
}
