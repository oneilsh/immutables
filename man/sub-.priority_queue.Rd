\usage{
\method{[}{priority_queue}(x, i, ...)

\method{[[}{priority_queue}(x, i, ...)

\method{[}{priority_queue}(x, i) <- value

\method{[[}{priority_queue}(x, i) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `priority_queue`.}

\item{i}{For `[`, character names.}

\item{...}{Unused.}

\item{value}{Replacement value (unsupported).}
}
\value{
For `[`, a `priority_queue` containing matched named entries.

For `[[`, one payload element matched by a single character name.

No return value; always errors because replacement indexing is unsupported.

No return value; always errors because replacement indexing is unsupported.
}
\description{
Priority queues intentionally expose only name-based read indexing.
}
\details{
For `[`:
- `i` must be character (one or more names).

For `[[`:
- `i` must be a single character name.

Numeric/logical indexing and replacement indexing are unsupported for
`priority_queue`. Cast with [as_flexseq()] for full sequence-style indexing.

q <- as_priority_queue(c("A", "B"), priorities = c(2, 1), names = c("a", "b"))
