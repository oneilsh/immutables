\usage{
tree_from(x, monoids = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Elements to insert.}

\item{monoids}{Optional named list of `measure_monoid` objects.}
}
\value{
A finger tree with cached measures for all monoids.
  If `x` has names, they are used for name-based indexing and must be
  complete (no missing/empty names) and unique.

\examples{
t <- tree_from(letters[1:4])
t[[2]]

sum_m <- measure_monoid(`+`, 0, as.numeric)
t2 <- tree_from(1:5, monoids = list(sum = sum_m))
attr(t2, "measures")

# Named elements support character indexing
tn <- tree_from(setNames(as.list(letters[1:3]), c("k1", "k2", "k3")))
tn[["k2"]]
