Risk: callers relying previous argument names/error behavior need updates. eb493fd: removed delete_one/delete_all; peek_key() pop_key() now support = \"first\"|\"\" \"\" operates full duplicate-key runs returns ordered slice. Risk: code using deleted functions assuming pop_key() always pops one element must migrate. eb493fd: pop_front()/pop_back() now return element (value) plus rest; tests/docs/vignette updated. Risk: callers using $value must switch $element. eb493fd: removed ordered_multiset API/tests dropped package-level set-op generics (union/intersect/setdiff) tied surface. Risk: code importing package methods must migrate explicit sequence operations. eb493fd: hardened C++ monoid/measures field access GC pressure src/ft_cpp.cpp (name lookup fallback monoid subfields; recursive fallback .size/.named_count reads measure names missing). Risk: GC torture remains expensive; pop_key(='') excluded GC-stress assertions keep suite deterministic. eb493fd: ensure_size_monoids() now canonicalizes every monoid spec named list(f, , measure) validates f/measure functions use. Impact: C++ positional fallback remains safe even monoid list names absent; risk: malformed custom MeasureMonoid objects now fail earlier clearer errors. eb493fd: benchmark harness longer references removed ordered_multiset/set-op scenarios; quick/full profiles now target live APIs . Risk: historical OMS benchmark comparisons longer directly reproducible default profiles. eb493fd: quick/full benchmark profiles now include ordered_sequence_insert keep ordered-keyed workload coverage OMS removal; pq_insert_pop remains available custom-scenario. Risk: historical quick/full trend lines one scenario changed. eb493fd: full-profile benchmark sizes reduced high-cost R-backend scenarios (flexseq_tree_from*, split variants, index reads, as_flexseq_only) keep single-scenario runs within ~30s capped. Risk: full-profile values less stress-heavy earlier settings. eb493fd: fixed insert.ordered_sequence() R fallback boundary case (use_cpp=FALSE) avoiding public push_back() guard appending split-left fragments; ordered_sequence_insert benchmarks now execute R backend. Risk: internal append helper path continue preserve ordered wrapping invariants (covered ordered-sequence tests). eb493fd: benchmark coverage now includes additional non-flexseq structure scenarios (ordered_sequence_bounds, pq_insert_pop) quick/full profiles R-safe parameter sizes. Risk: scenario names/default params changed; compare historical runs scenario+params, just run label. eb493fd: added deeper ordered-sequence priority-queue benchmark scenarios (ordered_sequence_range_queries, ordered_sequence_pop_cycle, pq_peek_min_max, pq_pop_min_drain, pq_mixed_ops) improve optimization signal across lookup vs mutation-heavy paths. Risk: broader quick/full profiles increase total run time; use run_scenarios() focused profiling. f300088: interval_index query surface now uses peek_point/peek_overlaps/peek_containing/peek_within plus pop_point/relation pop_*; removed find_* interval query helpers exports/docs/tests. Risk: callers using removed find_* APIs must migrate peek_*/pop_*. f300088: ordered-subclass blocker errors now report concrete subclass names inherited mutation endpoints (c, push_front, push_back, insert_at, [<-, [[<-, $<-) rather hardcoded ordered_sequence. Risk: callers/tests matching exact prior error strings may need updates. 53437c6+local: removed legacy internal ordered merge path (.ft_cpp_oms_set_merge) R wrapper, C registration, C++ implementation, parity/GC test references “ordered merge” remains true across layers. Risk: developer-code invoking removed internal symbol now errors must wait planned clean reimplementation. 53437c6+local: tightened test signal quality (validate_* now asserts invisible TRUE, redundant test-seq-apply monoid case folded one stronger persistence assertion, element tests now assert value-level identity list/data.frame payloads). Risk: stricter tests may fail immediately semantics intentionally change require explicit test updates. local: pure-R core execution now routes reference implementations tree_from bulk build, concat/app3, end-op append/prepend paths; legacy core fast-R files removed CI now includes forced-R backend test workflow (r-backend-reference). Risk: fallback mode can slower, behavior now easier audit tests/parity. local: interval_index now maintains additional reserved subtree monoids (.ivx_max_end, .ivx_min_end) routes peek_*/pop_* relation operations shared pruning-aware query engine; pop_* (='') uses span partition + linear rebuild benchmark coverage now includes interval_index_overlaps_all_stress. Risk: C++-enabled mixed-query scenarios may need follow-tuning despite improved forced-R fallback times. Root cause: bare SEXP variables holding newly-allocated R objects (R function calls make_* helpers) invisible R’s GC, scan C++ stack. subsequent R allocation (including Rcpp Function::operator() building call via Rf_lang3) can trigger GC collect temporaries. Pattern 1 — unprotected R function results used args another R function call: e.g. SEXP m = measure(ch); f(acc.get(), m). f() call allocates build LANGSXP executing, collecting m. Fix: Shield<SEXP> m(measure(ch)); f(acc.get(), (SEXP)m). Affected: measures_from_children, measure_sequence, locate_digit_impl_cpp, split_digit_cpp. Pattern 2 — multiple make_* results direct arguments make_deep: e.g. make_deep(make_digit(...), make_empty(...), make_digit(...), monoids). C++ argument eval order implementation-defined; make_* allocates heavily. Fix: Shield result passing. Affected: tree_from_sorted_list_cpp, digit_to_tree_cpp. Pattern 3 — unprotected make_* results List::push_back: push_back reallocates list, can collect unprotected temporary. Fix: Shield push_back. Affected: measured_nodes_cpp. Safe patterns (fix needed): d[\"prefix\"], sm[\"left\"], ms[monoid_name] etc. return pointers existing protected lists — elements kept alive parent objects attribute chain back .Call arguments. Shield<SEXP> ReprotectSEXP usage add_right_cpp, add_left_cpp, viewL_cpp, viewR_cpp already correct. Testing: IMMUTABLES_GC_STRESS=1 gctorture2(1) reliably triggers bugs. Always run GC torture C++ changes touching SEXP temporaries. local: added repo-local review workflow skill .agents/skills/immutables-review/SKILL.md plus durable review artifacts .review/ (curriculum.md, progress-ledger.md, issue-queue.md). Default review rule: run tests without explicit user approval unless user grants temporary session override. local: review intent user learning-first: session choose best next topic, point specific code anchors (file + line), explain behavior/invariants exact sections. local: review started/resumed (“review”, “continue review”), default response mode must guided walkthrough anchor-based explanations; fall back silent audit-style “issues” summaries unless user explicitly asks findings-mode.","code":""},{"path":"https://oneilsh.github.io/immutables/articles/flexseq.html","id":"creating-sequences","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Creating sequences","title":"Getting Started with flexseq","text":"flexseq objects persistent (immutable) sequences. update returns new object.","code":"x <- flexseq(1, 2, 3) x #> Unnamed flexseq with 3 elements. #>  #> Elements: #>  #> [[1]] #> [1] 1 #>  #> [[2]] #> [1] 2 #>  #> [[3]] #> [1] 3  x2 <- as_flexseq(letters[1:5]) x2 #> Unnamed flexseq with 5 elements. #>  #> Elements: #>  #> [[1]] #> [1] \"a\" #>  #> [[2]] #> [1] \"b\" #>  #> ...
